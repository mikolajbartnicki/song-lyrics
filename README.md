# song-lyrics

A collection of song lyrics with the corresponding chords for guitar and ukulele, in a printer-friendly format.

The chords provided are not official by any means. They are based mostly on what I hear, and since I do not have any musical education nor ear training, they may differ from the ones that can be found on the Internet, and even more from the originals. Some of them are slightly simplified. Some of them are transposed to the key I can sing in. Feel free to use them as you need, but you have been warned.

I do not claim any copyright for the lyrics and chords presented here. I gathered them all together for my own convenience, to have them handy and ready to print.
